Description of these files:

1. The are narrowPeak files refined by idr.
2. Because the original file names are too long, I renamed all of them by choosing only the part before "_VS_" and keeping the original suffix.
3. For convenience, the column 3 in all these narrowPeak files are given the name of the lab + element + cell line and so on (just the name of the renamed file).
